# disk partitioning

## Understanding Mounting
- In simple terms, we know mounting as inserting eg a usb drive into your computer 
- What really happens is that the system attaches a folder to the usb drive so that you can access its files. This happens to all other storage devices like a CD-ROM or a hard drive or even a floppy disk ( :) outdated) .The folder which the system attaches storage device is the mount point
- The main hard drive partition is mounted as "/" which is the root.
- CD-ROM - /media/cdrom
- USB drive - /mnt/usb
